# Providers

Swapkin started as a Claude Code account switcher. It is now a small engine
plus one file per tool ("provider") that knows how that tool stores a login.
Claude keeps working exactly as before; everything below is what changed and
how to add your own tool.

## Picking a provider

```
swapkin -p codex usage
swapkin --provider copilot list --json
SWAPKIN_PROVIDER=codex swapkin status
```

No `-p`/`--provider`/`SWAPKIN_PROVIDER` means `claude`, and every command the
panel and status line already use (`list --json`, `usage`, `cost`,
`statusline`, `use`, `add`, `colour`, `remove`, `check`) still means Claude by
default, unchanged.

## What each provider looks like

Three modes:

- **hot** — one shared login file (Claude Code only; see below for why a
  custom provider cannot be hot). A switch saves the outgoing account's live
  login back into its own profile, then overwrites the live file with the
  incoming account's. Open sessions notice on their next request.
- **cold** — a separate home per account (Codex, or a custom cold provider).
  A switch only moves a pointer: `swapkin use <name>` decides which account
  *new* sessions get. Point a shell at one with `eval "$(swapkin env <id>)"`,
  or run one directly with `swapkin run <id> -- <args>`. Sessions already
  running keep whatever they started with.
- **never** — the tool only remembers one login; switching means signing in
  again. (No built-in provider ships as `never` in v1; the mode exists for a
  future one.)

Copilot is a special cold case: it is backed by `gh`'s own account switch
(`gh auth switch`), so `swapkin -p copilot use <name>` runs that instead of
moving files around.

## New commands

- `swapkin providers --json` — every provider that is installed or has a
  saved account, with its accounts and their usage. Read-only, no network:
  it reads each account's already-saved `usage.json`.
- `swapkin usage` — with no `-p`/`SWAPKIN_PROVIDER`, probes every provider in
  the background and waits. With `-p`, probes just that one (as `usage`
  always did for Claude).
- `swapkin check` — one watchdog pass, regardless of `-p`: Claude by default,
  plus Codex when `autoSwitchProviders` lists it (see the README's Settings).
  The watchdog lives in `bin/lib/watchdog.sh`; an adapter can refine it with
  `plausible_login`, `p_watch_fresh`, `p_watch_switched` and
  `P_WATCH_RESETS_EXPIRE` (described at the top of that file).
- `swapkin env [id]` — for cold providers, prints `export KEY=value` lines
  for the active account (paths and names only, never a token). With no id,
  prints one block per cold provider. Put it in a shell rc:
  `eval "$(swapkin env)"`.
- `swapkin run <id> [-- args]` — runs that provider's own CLI with its
  active account's environment already set.
- `swapkin demo on|off` — turns demo mode on or off.

## Storage layout

```
$SWAPKIN_DIR/<name>/                     Claude — unchanged
$SWAPKIN_DIR/active                      Claude's active pointer — unchanged
$SWAPKIN_DIR/providers/<id>/<name>/      every other provider
$SWAPKIN_DIR/providers/<id>/active
```

`$SWAPKIN_DIR` defaults to `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/swapkin`.

## Your own provider: `~/.config/swapkin/providers.json`

```json
{
  "providers": [
    { "id": "mytool", "name": "My Tool", "command": "mytool", "mode": "cold",
      "homeEnv": "MYTOOL_HOME", "defaultHome": "~/.mytool",
      "usageCommand": "mytool usage --json" },

    { "id": "other", "name": "Other", "command": "other", "mode": "cold",
      "homeEnv": "OTHER_HOME", "defaultHome": "~/.other",
      "loginCommand": "other login",
      "usageCommand": "other usage --json" }
  ]
}
```

- `id` follows the same rules as an account name (`a-z0-9_-`) and can't reuse
  a built-in id (`claude`, `codex`, `copilot`).
- **Custom providers are cold-only.** An entry with `"mode": "hot"` (or any
  mode other than `cold`), or with a `loginFiles` array, is ignored with a
  warning on stderr, before anything is created for it. Hot mode overwrites
  a live login file at a path the user supplies. Validating that write path
  safely against symlink swaps between the check and the write could not be
  done reliably in bash (each `mkdir`/`mktemp`/`mv` re-resolves the path
  from scratch, so an ancestor swapped for a symlink in between is followed
  anyway), so hot stays a built-in-only mode with fixed, hardcoded paths.
  Cold mode has no such write: swapkin never writes into `defaultHome`, and
  every file it creates for a later account lives under its own
  `<profile>/home`.
- `defaultHome` is expanded from `~` and must resolve under `$HOME`,
  following symlinks: `~/.mytool` symlinked into `~/dotfiles/mytool` is
  fine, a link that leads outside `$HOME` is refused. `$HOME` itself (`"~"`)
  is refused too, and only a leading `~` is expanded — `~user` is not. The
  resolved path is what is stored.
- The file is **ignored, with a warning on stderr**, unless it is owned by
  you and not writable by your group or anyone else. It runs commands
  (`usageCommand`, `loginCommand`), so a config an attacker could edit is a
  config swapkin will not read.
- **cold**: `homeEnv` is the environment variable your tool reads for its
  home directory; `defaultHome` is where the existing login already lives.
  The first account references `defaultHome` directly — never copied, since
  a copied refresh token would rotate under the original. Later accounts get
  their own `<profile>/home`; `loginCommand` runs with `homeEnv` pointed at
  it so you can sign in (`timeout --foreground 300`, so an interactive
  prompt can still read the terminal; `add` then checks the home actually
  gained something before saying "Saved"). `swapkin use` only flips which account new sessions
  get; `swapkin env <id>` / `swapkin run <id>` are how a shell or a one-off
  command actually picks it up.
- **usageCommand**: run with `SWAPKIN_PROFILE=<profile dir>` (and `homeEnv`
  for cold providers) and a 20s timeout. It must print the `usage.json`
  shape below on stdout. Invalid JSON leaves the last good `usage.json` in
  place.

## `usage.json` (what `p_probe` writes per account)

```json
{
  "limits": [
    { "label": "Weekly", "title": "Weekly", "percent": 0.42, "resetsAt": "2026-10-01T00:00:00Z",
      "used": 84, "limit": 200, "unit": "requests" }
  ],
  "counts": [
    { "label": "Requests today", "value": 17, "unit": "requests" }
  ],
  "tierLabel": "Pro",
  "note": "",
  "updatedAt": "2026-09-24T12:00:00Z"
}
```

`percent` is a fraction (0..1); the panel multiplies by 100. `label` has to
let the panel tell windows apart — something matching `Session (5-hour)` /
`5h window` / `Weekly` / `... month ...` — `title` is an optional override for
display. For a tool with no hard ceiling, use `counts` instead of inventing a
percent.

## Safety

A login made by hand under the currently-active account name (for example
running the tool's own `/login` or `login` command directly, instead of
through `swapkin add`) is saved into that account on the next `save`, `use`,
or `usage` — because swapkin has no way to tell it apart from that account's
own login. Sign in through `swapkin add` instead when you mean to add a new
account, not replace the current one.

## Demo mode

`swapkin demo on` (or `SWAPKIN_DEMO=1`) makes every read command
(`providers --json`, `list --json`, `status`, `statusline`, `cost`) answer
from `demo/providers.json` — invented accounts (`work`, `personal`,
`side-project`) with invented numbers, so a screenshot always looks current
(reset times are stored as minute offsets and turned into real timestamps at
read time). Every command that would touch a login or the network — `use`,
`add`, `remove`, `save`, `colour`, `usage`, `check`, `env`, `run` — prints
`swapkin: demo mode, nothing changed` and exits, without reading or writing
anything real.
